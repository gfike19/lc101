    <main class ="m"><p>Eons ago, in a galaxy far far away there was a world filled with magic.
        Elves, humans, dwarves, and every sort of magical beast imaginable lived in harmony.
        Then a human named Thrakos was spurned by the love of his life for she loved an elf
        named Aseph who was more powerful then he. Thrakos became enraged and sought to become
        a magician, using dark and forbidden arts. His magic taxed the land, for with magic
        the energy must come from either the user or elsewhere. His love was killed by such means
        and yet he still did not blame himself for these action. Rahter he used his magic to enslave
        the elves and all who sought to aid them. </p>
        <p>Dismayed by the loss of life around them, a coalition of creatures from dragons to centaurs
            formed and attempted to overthrow Thrakos but to no avail for he empowered those who had held
            prejudices against all who were non humans. In time the land was sapped dry of its energy and source
            and so the mad magician moved west toward the mountains to find more stores of energy to maintain his
            powers</p>
            <article>There some that feel magic should never have existed, that it is a curse.
            With this mindset, a group of humans has made it their mission to capture, or as they say
          "rescue", those who posses magical abilities and take them away, whether the individual desires
        to or not. No one knows what becomes of the "afflicted" individual, some speculate they are put into
      a deep sleep until they can be "cured".</article>
        <p>Though Thrakos had left and the land eventually healed thanks to the diligent work of the elves,
            mistrust among the races still lingered. No longer was there union amongst one another, humans feared
            magic lest another Thrakos arise. Dwarves went deep into the mountains for the outer world had
            decimated their numbers. The merfolk fled to the farthest of the seas. The creatures of the forest from
            fauns to pixies hid from all. Anyone not like themselves was not to be trusted. This is where this
            story begins</p>
